# Python Practice Repository

Welcome to my Python Practice repository! This space is dedicated to learning and experimenting with Python concepts. Whenever I practice something new, I will create a separate branch for it.

## Purpose

- Practice Python programming
- Explore new libraries, frameworks, and concepts
- Maintain a clean history of learning through branches

## How This Repo Is Organized

- The `main` branch contains general information and documentation.
- Each new topic or concept will have its own branch.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-practice.git
    ```
2. Checkout any branch to see specific practice code:
    ```bash
    git checkout branch-name
    ```

## Contributions

This repository is for personal learning, but suggestions are welcome!

Happy Coding!
